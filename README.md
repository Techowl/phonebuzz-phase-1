phonebuzz
=========

A simple Sinatra app that uses TwiML and the Twilio API to play FizzBuzz over the phone.

##Phase 1 Instructions
Point your Twilio number to http://phonebuzz.herokuapp.com/hello, specifying that HTTP GET requests will be used.

If you would like to run the app locally, you can do so as long as you have ruby and bundler installed.

```
bundle
ruby app.rb
```
